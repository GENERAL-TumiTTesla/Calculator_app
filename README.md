# Collection of GDSC problems I solved 
Greetings there viewer!

Glad to see you swing by.
This repository contains all the problems that I encountered and had to solve either live or as homework, during my time of attending the '100 Days of Code' event in the GDSC (Goggle Development Student Club) of my university.

I hope this repository helps you get the solutions to particular problems that you might be looking for or give you an insight of my learning path.

I plan on documenting my learning path through various repositories, which will come handy as evidence to solving problems and will allow me to jump back in the past to reconcile my journey and upgrade my then amateur code.
